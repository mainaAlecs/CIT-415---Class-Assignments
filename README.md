# CIT-415---Class-Assignments
Work on the following program: (make use of objects and classes)
a.
Write a program with a class called Employee. This class should extend the class Person. This program should give us every single detail of this employee that you deem important for an employer to know. Assuming this person is also a student within the employment institution, create accounts that represent this personâ€™s details as a person, an employee and a student. Be sure not to apply redundancy in the process.
b.
Write a program with a static method that validates things like email address, passwords and other common input fields.
c.
Create a library maintenance system with classes such as libraryitem, book details, dvd, students etc. This system should allow us perform the normal library operations without using a database. Implement appropriate properties and methods for each class.
